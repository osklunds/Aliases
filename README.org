dotfiles I use

** Emacs todos

*** Must have

- tab bar with cached buffers
- super-save manually
- Temporarily disable magit key bindings

*** Nice to have

- Make colors clearer on some monitors
- Make diff colors clearer, maybe mimic vim's
- Organization
  - Machine specific .el file
- terminal
  - Move somewhere else in insert mode
- Switch to vertico/consult/marginella
  - Will fix LSP search for functions
  - Will fix live preview of ripgrep results
- Programming languages
  - LSP search for functions
  - Improve/streamline company or other completion
  - Maybe if possible: company mode only in source blocks
- lines around cursorline
- Merge Survival Knife
- Keybind in normal empties line

*** Not that important

- Use e.g. Ctrl-left to move MRU buffers
- evil
  - Make magit ? show bindings for evil mode
  - Exit visual mode when search replace is done
- alt-ret for continuing list also outside org-mode

** VIM todos

*** Wanted, but hard to do

- Box around the cursorline, like VSCode
- Conflict markers highlight all the way to the left and right edges, like VSCode, and like e.g. CursorLine and DiffAdd
- Better diff, like Gerrit
-  line numbers also in terminal mode
