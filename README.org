dotfiles I use

** Emacs todos

*** Housekeeping

- Use setc when appropriate
- Define a wrapper for evil-define-key that does kbd
- Clean up key bindings file and functions used

*** Must have

- Live preview in fuzzy find and ripgrep etc
- Cache-less file finder, using counsel-rg?

*** Nice to have

- Make diff colors clearer, maybe mimic vim's
- Organization
  - Machine specific .el file
- terminal
  - vterm for making the experience more similar to a normal terminal
- Merge Survival Knife
- Keybind in normal empties line

*** Not that important

- evil
  - Make magit ? show bindings for evil mode
  - Exit visual mode when search replace is done
- alt-ret for continuing list also outside org-mode
- Switch to vertico/consult/marginella
  - Will fix live preview of ripgrep results

** VIM todos

*** Wanted, but hard to do

- Box around the cursorline, like VSCode
- Conflict markers highlight all the way to the left and right edges, like VSCode, and like e.g. CursorLine and DiffAdd
- Better diff, like Gerrit
-  line numbers also in terminal mode
