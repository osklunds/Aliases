dotfiles I use

** Emacs todos

*** Housekeeping


*** Must have

- Native compilation of packages and my files
- Merge Survival Knife

*** Nice to have

- Organization
  - Register external dependencies
  - Machine specific .el file
- terminal
  - vterm for making the experience more similar to a normal terminal
- Undo each step in search-and-replace

*** Not that important

- evil
  - Exit visual mode when search replace is done
- alt-ret for continuing list also outside org-mode
- Switch to vertico/consult/marginella

*** Wanted, but hard to do

- Box around the cursorline, like VSCode

** VIM todos

*** Wanted, but hard to do

- Box around the cursorline, like VSCode
- Conflict markers highlight all the way to the left and right edges, like VSCode, and like e.g. CursorLine and DiffAdd
- Better diff, like Gerrit
-  line numbers also in terminal mode
