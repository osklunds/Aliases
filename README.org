** Emacs todos

*** Must have

*** Nice to have

- space leader in dired
- Disable most keys in insert mode, but ctrl-d, ctrl-x-e should work
- Use e.g. Ctrl-left to move MRU buffers
- find a way to not move cursor in term mode when going to insert mode
- Switch to vertico/consult/marginella
  - Will fix LSP search for functions
  - Will fix live preview of ripgrep results
- magit
  - in status buffer, only diff HEAD and working tree
  - When commiting, etc, use a default layout with status to the left,
    and msg to the right, as if it was executed in the left buffer
  - Make vdiff work for status buffer
- Programming languages
  - LSP search for functions
  - Haskell tags
  - Rust tags
  - Improve/streamline company or other completion
  - Maybe if possible: company mode only in source blocks
- Company mode
  - no icons
- evil
  - Make magit ? show bindings for evil mode
  - Exit visual mode when search replace is done
- ivy
  - In switch buffer, find file, ripgrep, split selection to a new window
- Org mode
  - Images
  - Charts
  - References to other sections
- Use built-in modeline
  - Simplify the modeline a lot, and have a status command that instead show those details
- lines around cursorline
- Merge Survival Knife
- clean up all messy keybindings into a separete file
- Keybind in normal empties line
- C-k in normal is like C-6 but continues to go backwards
- json optimization for LSP
- Move color configs to separate file
- vdiff
  - make it smoother
- terminal
  - C-y for paste
  - Move somewhere else in insert mode
- alt-ret for continuing list also outside org-mode
    

** VIM todos

*** Wanted, but hard to do

- Box around the cursorline, like VSCode
- Conflict markers highlight all the way to the left and right edges, like VSCode, and like e.g. CursorLine and DiffAdd
- Better diff, like Gerrit
-  line numbers also in terminal mode
