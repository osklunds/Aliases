dotfiles I use

** Emacs todos

*** Must have

*** Nice to have

- Make colors clearer on some monitors
- Make diff colors clearer, maybe mimic vim's
- mode-line
  - Show if file is RO only
  - Get rid if git-prefix of vc-mode
  - Show something other than - as project name if no project
  - Make the code for mode line cleaner
- Organization
  - Machine specific .el file
  - Lock submodules to specific commit
- terminal
  - Move somewhere else in insert mode
- Switch to vertico/consult/marginella
  - Will fix LSP search for functions
  - Will fix live preview of ripgrep results
- Programming languages
  - LSP search for functions
  - Haskell tags
  - Rust tags
  - Improve/streamline company or other completion
  - Maybe if possible: company mode only in source blocks
- Use built-in modeline
  - Simplify the modeline a lot, and have a status command that instead show those details
- lines around cursorline
- Merge Survival Knife
- Keybind in normal empties line

*** Not that important

- Disable most keys in insert mode, but ctrl-d, ctrl-x-e should work
- space leader in dired
- Use e.g. Ctrl-left to move MRU buffers
- evil
  - Make magit ? show bindings for evil mode
  - Exit visual mode when search replace is done
- alt-ret for continuing list also outside org-mode
- C-k for switching only between terminal buffers?

** VIM todos

*** Wanted, but hard to do

- Box around the cursorline, like VSCode
- Conflict markers highlight all the way to the left and right edges, like VSCode, and like e.g. CursorLine and DiffAdd
- Better diff, like Gerrit
-  line numbers also in terminal mode
