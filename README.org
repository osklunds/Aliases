dotfiles I use

** Emacs todos

*** Must have

*** Nice to have

- Disable most keys in insert mode, but ctrl-d, ctrl-x-e should work
- terminal
  - C-y for paste
  - Move somewhere else in insert mode
- find a way to not move cursor in term mode when going to insert mode
- Switch to vertico/consult/marginella
  - Will fix LSP search for functions
  - Will fix live preview of ripgrep results
- Programming languages
  - LSP search for functions
  - Haskell tags
  - Rust tags
  - Improve/streamline company or other completion
  - Maybe if possible: company mode only in source blocks
- Org mode
  - Images
  - Charts
  - References to other sections
- Use built-in modeline
  - Simplify the modeline a lot, and have a status command that instead show those details
- lines around cursorline
- Merge Survival Knife
- Keybind in normal empties line
- C-k in normal is like C-6 but continues to go backwards
- json optimization for LSP

*** Not that important

- space leader in dired
- Use e.g. Ctrl-left to move MRU buffers
- evil
  - Make magit ? show bindings for evil mode
  - Exit visual mode when search replace is done
- Move color configs to separate file
- alt-ret for continuing list also outside org-mode

** VIM todos

*** Wanted, but hard to do

- Box around the cursorline, like VSCode
- Conflict markers highlight all the way to the left and right edges, like VSCode, and like e.g. CursorLine and DiffAdd
- Better diff, like Gerrit
-  line numbers also in terminal mode
